# Storage and retrieval using Filecoin+

This tutorial contains some words and phrases that you might not be familiar with:

| Word | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Wallet | A collection of addresses. Think of each wallet as a folder, and each address as a single file in that folder. |
| Address | A string of letters and numbers that other users can send FIL to. |
| Filecoin (upper-case `F`) | The network that transactions and storage deals take place on. |
| filecoin (lower-case `f`) | The cryptocurrency that the Filecoin network runs on. |
| FIL | The shorthand representation of the filecoin cryptocurrency. |
| Private key | A string of letters and numbers that programs use to interact with the Filecoin network. Keep your private key safe and don't share it with anyone. |
| [Block explorer](/get-started/explore-the-network/#block-explorers) | A service, usually a website, that lets you view details of a blockchain such as transactions, deals, and addresses. |

The Filecoin storage and retrival process is split into three main parts: the set-up, storing you data, and retrieving your data. Each part has several sub-processes that we need to follow.

1. Set up:

    a. Get access to a Lotus full-node.
    a. Start a Lotus lite-node on your local computer.
    a. Get a FIL address.
    a. Sign up to Filecoin+.

1. Store data: 

    a. Package your data.
    a. Import your data into Lotus.
    a. Find a miner through the MinerX program.
    a. Create a storage deal.
    a. Wait for the deal to complete.

1. Retrieve data:

    a. Create a retrieval deal.
    a. Download your data.

## Set up

<!-- TODO: Explain all the steps we're going to do in this section. -->

### Get access to a Lotus full-node

A Lotus full-node is a computer running the `lotus daemon`. Full-nodes are special because they have complete access to the Filecoin blockchain. The computer specifications required to run a Lotus full-node are fairly high, and might be out of reach for most end-user laptops and PCs. We recommend running a Lotus full-node on a remote server, or connecting to a service that has Lotus full-nodes ready for you.

::: tip
Several examples later in this guide will use a full node hosted by Protocol Labs, available at `api.chain.love`. This node is great for small experiments, but it's not suitable for production usage.

Lotus runs best on computers with at least 8 CPU cores and 16GB RAM. Lotus can run on most Linux distributions, and macOS. The following steps use Ubuntu 20.04. See the [Get started guide](/get-started/lotus/installation/) to find out how to run Lotus on a different operating system:

1. Create a server with at least 8 CPUs and 16GB RAM, and connect to it using SSH. If you're not sure how to connect to a server, or even how to spin one up in the first place, check out Digital Ocean's guide on how to set up a [Ubuntu 20.04 server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-ubuntu-20-04-server-on-a-digitalocean-droplet).
1. Make a note of your server's IP address. We'll be using this in an upcoming section.
1. Update the `apt` repositories and upgrade any out-of-date packages:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

1. Install the dependencies for Lotus:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd ocl-icd-opencl-dev gcc git bzr jq pkg-config curl clang build-essential hwloc libhwloc-dev wget -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
    echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc && ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Download Lotus and create the `lotus` executable:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git
    cd lotus/
    make clean all
    sudo make install
    ```

1. Start the Lotus daemon and download the latest snapshot:

    ```shell
    lotus daemon --import-chain https://fil-chain-snapshots-fallback.s3.amazonaws.com/mainnet/complete_chain_with_finality_stateroots_latest.car
    ```

1. Stop the `lotus daemon` process by pressing `CTRL` + `c`:
1. Open `~/.lotus/config` and:

    a. Uncommend line 3.
    a. Change `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`.

    ```toml
    ListenAddress = "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/1234/http"
    ```

    Save and exit the file.

1. Create an API token using the `write` permissions:

    ```shell
    lotus auth create-token --perm write
    ```

    Make a note of this **API token**. We will use it in a later section.

1. Start the Lotus daemon and download the latest snapshot at the same time:

    ```shell
    lotus daemon --import-snapshot https://fil-chain-snapshots-fallback.s3.amazonaws.com/mainnet/minimal_finality_stateroots_latest.car
    ```

    The Lotus daemon will continue to run. You can disconnect from the server now, but do not shut it down.

:::tip
Things to write down from this section:

1. Your server's IP address.
1. The API token from running `lotus auth create-token --perm write`.
:::

<!-- TODO: uncomment this section once we've figured out node-hosting services like Glif.
#### Connect to a node-hosting service
-->

### Install a Lotus lite-node on your local computer

You will need:

1. The IP address of your Lotus full-node.
1. If you created your own Lotus full-node, you will need the **API token** you created. If you are using a node-hosting service, you do not need an API token.

1. Open a terminal window.
1. Clone the [Lotus GitHub repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) and create the executable, but do not run anything yet:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus
    cd lotus
    make clean all
    sudo make install
    ```

1. Copy this command and enter your information:

    ```shell
    FULLNODE_API_INFO=<API_TOKEN>:/ip4/<YOUR_FULL_NODE_IP_ADDRESS>/tcp/1234 lotus daemon --lite
    ```

    Replace `<API_TOKEN>` with your API token, if you have one. Replace `<YOUR_FULL_NODE_IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of your Lotus full-node:

    ```shell
    FULLNODE_API_INFO=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJBbGxvdyI6WyJyZWFkIiwid3JpdGUiXX0.FfTKDJEy7yuSMDNXIsF292rRKNe6F8hWodX2r9g1T_8:/ip4/134.122.35.130/tcp/1234 lotus daemon --lite
    ```

    For small experiments, you can use a full node operated by Protocol Labs:

    ```shell
    FULLNODE_API_INFO="wss://api.chain.love" lotus daemon --lite
    ```

    The Lotus daemon will continue to run. Further commands must be ran from a seperate terminal window.

### Get a FIL address

1. Create an address using the `wallet new` command:

    ```shell
    lotus wallet new 

    > f1fwavjcfb32nxbczmh3kgdxhbffqjfsfby2otloi
    ```

    Lotus outputs your public address. Public addresses always start with `f1`.

1. Make a note of this address. We'll use it in an uncoming section.

### Sign up to Filecoin+

Filecoin Plus is a layer of social trust on top of the Filecoin network to help incentivize the storage of real data. Essentially, all Filecoin+ users who want to upload something to the Filecoin network can become a _verfied client_ by signing up to Filecoin+ using their GitHub account. All _verified clients_ get an allowance of 8GB per month to upload their data to the Filecoin network! 

1. Go to [plus.fil.org](plus.fil.org).
1. Under **Clients**, click **Proceed**.
1. Under **Get verified**, click **Get Verified**.
1. Click **Automatic Verification**.
1. In the `Request` field, enter the address you got in the previous section.

<!-- TODO: Get someone to follow this workflow and grab screenshots. --> 

### Next steps

Now that we've got all the set up out of the way, we can move onto storing data with the Filecoin network. 

## Store data

Now we can get started with _storing_ the stuff we want to archive on Filecoin. We first need to prepare it into a format that Lotus can manage.

### Prepare your data

We want to store the [ISS_COORDS_2021-03-25 dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/ISS_COORDS_2021-03-25/qti9-kibp) from NASA. If you've got some other data you'd prefer to store on Filecoin, go ahead and up that!

:::danger
Do not store personal data on the Filecoin network, even if it's encrypted. Access control is on the roadmap, but until then only store public and static data on the Filecoin network. 
:::

1. Download the ISS_COORDS_2021-03-25 dataset, extract it, and move the files into a new folder called `filecoin-package`:

    ```shell
    cd ~
    curl -o ISS_COORDS_DATASET.tar.gz https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYtymZ8C3yYWU6V7kbcS2mQx92be1Lwt1Ufa7JBo3Zd2Y
    tar -xvzf ISS_COORDS_DATASET.tar.gz
    mkdir ~/filecoin-payload-folder
    mv ISS_COORDS_DATASET/* ~/filecoin-payload-folder 
    ```

1. Move out of the `filecoin-payload-folder` and pack everything into a `.tar` file:

    ```shell
    cd ~
    tar -cvf ~/filecoin-payload.tar ~/filecoin-payload-folder
    ```

We now have our payload file ready to be stored using the Filecoin network.

### Add data to Lotus

We need to tell our Lotus lite-node which file we want to store using Filecoin.

1. Import the payload into the `lotus daemon` using the `import` command: 

    ```shell
    lotus client import ~/filecoin-payload.tar 
    ```

    Lotus creates a distributed-asyclic-graph (DAG) based off the payload. This process takes a few minutes. Once's it's complete Lotus will output the root CID of the payload.

    ```shell
    > Import 3, Root bafykb...
    ```

1. Make a note of the CID. We'll be using it in an upcoming section.

Now that Lotus knows which file we want to use, we can create a deal with a Filecoin miner to store our data!

### Find a miner that meets your needs

The Filecoin network allows data storage miners to compete with one another by offering different terms for pricing, acceptable data sizes, and other important deal parameters.
Before we can store data, we need to select a suitable miner.

There are a few resources available for finding dependable miners that will accept your data. 

#### Find a miner through the MinerX program

<!-- TODO: explain what the MinerX program is, why it exists, and why we need to use it instaed of using vanilla-Filecoin. -->

1. Go to [plus.fil.org/miners](https://plus.fil.org/miners/).
1. Using the table, find a miner that suits your needs. For the sake of this tutorial, look for a miner that is:
2. 
    a. Close to you.
    a. Offering verified-data deals for 0 FIL.
    
1. Once you have found a suitable miner, copy their `miner_id` from the **Miner ID** column:

    ![](./images/store-and-retrieve/miner-x-listings.png)

    Some miners list multiple miner IDs. For these miners, just copy one of the IDs:

    ![](./images/store-and-retrieve/miner-with-multiple-miner-ids.png)

1. Write down ID of the miner you want to use. We'll be referring to it in the next section.

#### Use a miner reputation system

The MinerX program is a great resource, but it represents a small portion of the entire Filecoin mining community. 
Filecoin reputation systems like [FilRep](https://filrep.io) can help compare miners based on their past performance and provide useful information about the deal parameters that a miner will accept.

Using FilRep, you can see and compare important miner parameters and metrics, including location, storage power in the network, pricing, and overall success rate.

The column selection widget lets you see even more details, including the minimum and maximum file sizes that a miner will accept:

![](./images/store-and-retrieve/filrep-select-columns.png)

Miner reputation systems can be used alongside programs like Miner X to find the best miner for your needs. 
To see what FilRep has to say about a member of the MinerX program, just paste the **Miner ID** from the MinerX list into the search box at https://filrep.io.

### Create a deal 

1. Start the interactive deal process:

    ```shell
    lotus client deal
    ```

    The interactive deal assistant will now ask you some questions.

1. Specify the CID of the file you want to backup on Filecoin. This is the CID that you got from running `lotus client import ~/filecoin-payload.tar`:

    ```shell
    Data CID (from lotus client import): bafykbz...
    ```

1. Wait for Lotus to finish building the `.car` file.

    ```shell
    > .. calculating data size 
    ```

    The duration of this process depends on the size of your file and the specification of your Lotus node. Lotus took around 25 minutes to build the `.car` file of a ~7.5GB file with an 8-core CPU and 16GB RAM.

1. Enter the number of days you want to keep this file on Filecoin for. The minimum is 180 days:

    ```shell
    > Deal duration (days): 365 
    ``` 

1. Tell Lotus whether or not this is a Filecoin+ deal. Since we signed up to Filecoin+ and added some DataCap to our wallet in an earlier step, we'll select `yes` here:

    ```shell
    > Make this a verified deal? (yes/no): yes
    ```

1. Enter the miner ID from the previous section: 

    ```shell
    > Miner Addresses (f0.. f0..), none to find: f3141592654 
    ```

    <!-- TODO: find out what happens after you throw in a MINER_ID. -->

1. Enter `0` when asked how much FIL we are willing to spend for this storage deal:

    ```shell
    > Maximum budget (FIL): 0.5
    ```

    <!-- TODO: find out what happens after you throw in a MINER_ID. -->

    Normally, we would enter a value of around `0.5 FIL` here. However, since we picked a miner that is accepting 0 FIL deals for verified storage deals, and we are a verified client, then we don't actually need to spend any FIL here!

1. Specify how many miners you want your file to be replicated over. The default it one 

    ```shell
    Deals to make (1): 1
    ```

1. Confirm your transaction:

    ```shell
    > -----
    > Proposing from f136b5uqa73jni2rr745d3nek4uw6qiy6b6zmmvcq
    >         Balance: 2 FIL
    > 
    > Piece size: 8GiB (Payload size: 7.445GiB)
    > Duration: 7200h0m0s
    > Total price: ~0 FIL (0 FIL per epoch)
    > Verified: true
    > 
    > Accept (yes/no): yes
    ```

1. Lotus will returns a **Deal CID**:

    ```shell
    .. executing
    Deal (f023978) CID: bafyreict2zhkbwy2arri3jgthk2jyznck47umvpqis3hc5oclvskwpteau
    ```

### Wait for the deal to complete

We need to wait for the miner to accept our deal and _seal_ the data. This process can take up to 24 hours to complete, depending on how much data we asked the miner to store.

1. List successful and pending deals by using the `list-deals` command:

    ```shell
    lotus client list-deals
    
    >
    ```
    <!-- TODO: show what happens when you list the deals. -->

    If you cannot see your deal in the list, the deal may have failed. Use `--list-failed` to see failed deals:

    ```shell
    lotus client list-deals --list-failed

    > 
    ```

    <!-- TODO: show what happens when you list failed the deals. -->

<!-- TODO: add a conclusiong to the storage deal steps. -->

## Retrieve

<!--
## Notes

Here's a collection of stuff I got stuck on, got confused about, or just didn't like.

### Deal states are confusing

We need to list out what the different _deal states_ mean. Like, mine is currently on `StorageDealClientFunding`. Is that good? In fact, we should probably list exactly what each item in this table means:

```
lotus client list-deals

> DealCid      DealId  Provider  State                     On Chain?  Slashed?  PieceCID     Size       Price             Duration  Verified  
> ...efwnzpxq  0       f0127354  StorageDealClientFunding  N          N         ...tun3yeoi  7.938 GiB  0.0002093832 FIL  523458    true  
```

### Calculating data size

Calculating data size takes quite a long time, and there's no output saying that it's still processing or loading. Also, if you start the deal making process but then cancel out after Lotus has calculated the data size, and then try to remake a deal using the same CID, Lotus tries to calculate the data size all over again! Why can't Lotus just check if it's already calculated the data size of that CID?

It took about 25 minutes to calculate the data size of a ~7.5GB file on an 8 core 16GB Digital Ocean droplet.

### From the deal making process:

```shell

## Troubleshooting

### ERROR: connect: connection refused

If you get an `connect: connection refused` error when trying to connect your Lotus lite-node to your Lotus full-node, it is likely because your full-node is not configured properly. Double check that your `~/.lotus/config.toml` file has line 3 uncommented and the address is set to `0.0.0.0`:

    ```shell
    [API]
    ListenAddress = "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/1234/http"
    #  RemoteListenAddress = ""
    ```

Reset your Lotus full-node computer if you are still facing issues after editing the `config.toml` file. Make sure to start the Lotus daemon with `lotus daemon` once the computer has booted back up.
